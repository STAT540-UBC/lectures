# Learning objectives (next two lectures)

&lt;big&gt;

* Understand *why* and *when* between and within sample normalization are needed

* Apply common between and within sample normalization approaches to RNA-seq counts

* Understand why the *count nature* of RNA-seq data requires modification to the Differential Expression approaches applied to microarray data (e.g. `limma`)

* Apply models such as **limma-trend, limma-voom, `DESeq2` and `edgeR`** for inference of Differential Expression

## Recall the CHD8 RNA-seq experiment

- [Gompers et al. (Nature Neuroscience 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6008102/) analyzed 26 Chd8+/del5 and 18 WT littermates

  - Tested for differential expression across 11,936 genes accounting for sex, developmental stage and sequencing batch

- We'll use this dataset throughout this lecture to illustrate RNA-seq analysis

# Now we have **count** data

* In the exploratory data analysis lecture, we worked with transformed values (specifically "logRPKM" - more on this later) - these were **continuous**

* Now we will work with the raw RNA-seq **counts** (discrete)

* These counts represent the number of reads mapping to each feature (gene or transcript) - here we have gene counts

* Seminar 6 explores how to obtain read counts from alignment (BAM or SAM) files

# Differential expression analysis on Chd8 data

* Main variable of interest: **Group** (Genotype: Chd8 mutant vs WT)

* We'd like to fit a model for each gene so we can test for Group effect, and adjust for:
  * **Sex** (M vs F, 2 level factor)
  * **DPC** (days post conception, 5 level factor)
  
--

* Using what we learned in previous lectures, we can formulate this model as

`$$Y_{i} = \theta + \tau_{Mut} x_{i,Mut} + \tau_{F} x_{i,F} + \tau_{D14.5} x_{i,D14.5} + \tau_{D17.5} x_{i,D17.5} + \tau_{D21} x_{i,D21} + \tau_{D77} x_{i,D77} + \epsilon_i$$`

--

&lt;small&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
`$$x_{i,Mut} = \bigg\{\begin{array}{l} 
1\text{ if sample } i \text{ is Mutant} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{array}, \hspace{1em} x_{i,F} = \bigg\{\begin{array}{l} 
1\text{ if sample } i \text{ is Female} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{array}, \hspace{1em}x_{i,D\#} = \bigg\{\begin{array}{l} 
1\text{ if sample } i \text{ is DPC#} \\
0 \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{array}$$`

where `\(D\# \in \{D14.5, D17.5, D21, D77\}\)`

---

# Differential expression analysis on Chd8 data

* Our model has no interaction term (though we could add one if we wish)

* `\(p=7\)` parameters to estimate in our model: `\(\theta, \tau_{Mut}, \tau_{F}, \tau_{D14.5}, \tau_{D17.5}, \tau_{D21}, \text{ and } \tau_{D77}\)`

* `\(n=44\)` samples total, so our model has `\(n-p=44-7=37\)` degrees of freedom

* How can we test whether there is differential expression between Chd8 Mut and WT using our model?

--

* Recall that since this is an additive model, the parameters represent **main effects**

# Are we ready to fit the model?

&lt;big&gt;

Might start with the `limma` approach on the raw counts, but...

--

**Not so fast** - we have to consider additional sources of variation!

---

## Library size (sequencing depth)

* **Library size**: Total number of read counts per sample

* Ideally this would be the same for all samples, but it isn't

* Number of reads per sample depends on factors like how many samples were multiplexed and how evenly, cluster density, RNA quality, etc.

]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/clusterdensity.png" width="324" /&gt;
]

---

# Why does library size matter?

* We want to compare gene counts **between** samples

* Intuition: if we sequence one group of samples twice as much, gene counts in that sample look roughly twice as large even if there's no DE!

--

* **Between samples** â€“ higher sequencing depths leads to higher gene/transcript read counts

&lt;img src="img/seqdepth.png" width="550" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
--

* You may come across (older) papers in the literature where data was down-sampled to make library sizes the same (**not recommended**)

---

# Within-sample comparisons

* Other factors of variation come into play if we also want to compare counts between genes within sample (less common)

* At the same expression level, longer genes/transcripts have more read counts

&lt;img src="img/genelength.png" width="550" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## How can we make fair between- and within-sample comparisons?

* **Normalized expression units**: expression values adjusted for factors like library size, gene length

  * e.g.RPKM/FPKM, TPM, CPM
  * useful for visualization / clustering

* **Normalization factors**: scalar values representing relative library size of each sample

  * e.g. TMM, DESeq size factors 
  * useful to include in models of raw counts to adjust for library size

--

* For analysis (e.g. DE) it is ideal to start with **raw counts**

  * raw counts required for many methods
  * can always compute normalized values from raw counts (but not vice versa)

---

# Normalized expression units

&lt;big&gt;

* **RPKM/FPKM**: reads/fragments per kb of exon per million mapped reads

`\(R_{ij} = 28\)` reads in gene `\(j\)`, sample `\(i\)`

`\(\Sigma_j R_{ij} = 11\)` million reads in sample i

`\(RPKM_{ij} = \frac{R_{ij}}{\frac{L_j}{10^3}\frac{\Sigma_j R_{ij}}{10^6}} = \frac{28}{\frac{2000}{10^3}\frac{1.1\times10^7}{10^6}} = 1.27\)`

]

* RPKM is the more appropriate term for paired-end data

---

# Normalized expression units, continued

&lt;big&gt;

* **TPM**: Transcripts per million `$$TPM_{ij} = \frac{R_{ij}}{L_j}\frac{10^6}{\Sigma_j R_{ij}/L_j} = \frac{FPKM_{ij}}{\Sigma_j FPKM_{ij}/10^6}$$`

--

* **CPM**: Counts per million `$$CPM_{ij} = \frac{R_{ij}}{\Sigma_j R_{ij}/10^6}$$`

--

* See this useful [blog post](https://haroldpimentel.wordpress.com/2014/05/08/what-the-fpkm-a-review-rna-seq-expression-units/) on relationship between these units

* Which of these measures are between-sample normalization measures? Within-sample? Both?

---

# How much does "gene length" vary?

* Really we mean "total effective length of transcript used in assigning reads to genes"

* If all genes are same lengths, FPKM won't do anything interesting

* In mouse, "gene length" varies `\(&gt;3\)` orders of magnitude, but mostly ~2.5Kb - 4.3Kb

* Your organism may vary

&lt;img src="lect10-RNAseq1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

## How does gene length relate to counts?

*  If all genes were actually expressed at same level (RNA molecules per cell), we'd expect a perfect relation

* Of course genes are not all expressed at the same level, so we expect the effect of length to be less obvious

* Rank correlation between length and mean expression in our example data is ~0.59

# Between-sample normalization

&lt;big&gt;

* Computing FPKM, CPM or TPM largely corrects for differences in library size

* However, there is a complication: "Sequence space"
  * Finite number of reads implies that observing reads for one gene decreases ability to observe reads for other genes
  * This is a fundamental difference from microarrays, where each spot is essentially independent

* This isn't a major problem unless there are large differences in composition between samples, but should be inspected

  * Normalization factors are generally robust to this

---

# Effect of sequence space

&lt;img src="img/seqspace.png" width="493" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

* By CPM or FPKM, red and blue gene appear be down-regulated in sample B (green gene really is diff ex)

* Adjusting expression levels in Sample B by a factor of 3 would be needed

&lt;small&gt;
See [Robinson and Oshlack (2010)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25)

---

# Sequence space in our example data

* One gene with `\(&gt;100,000\)` mean reads per sample `\((&gt;5\%\)` of data in some samples): Rn45s

* Overall, 5% of the genes take up ~50% of the space in this data set, but this is reasonably consistent across the samples

* Side note: Rn45s is potentially a contaminant - a ribosomal RNA that should have been removed during sample prep, which involved poly-A selection

&lt;img src="lect10-RNAseq1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="1008" /&gt;

??? 

This isnâ€™t too bad â€“ in some data sets one gene is 20% of the data...


---

## Normalization factors

.pull-left[
* Estimate effective library size, accounting for "sequence space"

* Not used as a direct data adjustment, but included in a statistical model

* Example: **TMM** â€“ "trimmed means of M-values"
  * M-values: per-gene ratios of counts among samples
  * Trimmed: extreme values are ignored
  * Values adjusted to have product = 1
  * Assumes that no more than half of genes are DE
  * Calculate with `edgeR::calcNormFactors`

# Alternative: Quantile normalization

.pull-left[
* Essentially: rank transformation

* Effect: Force all samples to have the same distribution of expression values

* Not typically applied in RNA-seq analyses unless there still exist large differences in distributions among samples after standard normalization procedures, and reason to believe they aren't biological

* Algorithm:
  * Rank transform (sample-by-sample)
  * Replace each rank with the mean (across samples) of the observed value at that rank

## Preprocessing: filtering lowly expressed genes

* Common step which can be beneficial for a few reasons:

  * Genes with very low mean expression across samples may be uninteresting
  
  * Fitting models on a smaller number of genes can be faster
  
  * May obtain a more 'well-behaved' association between mean and variance, which might affect some methods (e.g. Voom)
  
* No universal threshold - depends on library size of dataset, and possibly mean-variance trend

* Original study: keep genes with `\(&gt;2\)` samples that have CPM greater `\(&gt;10\)`

## Differential expression: Why we need new methods

&lt;big&gt;

* **Goal**: accurate p-values for our hypothesis tests

  * Accurate:  "Uniform under the null"
  
  * Properties relied upon for inference from `\(t\)`-statistics won't hold for count data

* Perhaps most important: **Heteroskedasticity** and **Overdispersion**
  
  * Strong mean-variance relationship expected with count data
  
  * Biological variance over and above binomial sampling variance
  
---

# Properties of expression data: counts

NOTE: We are focused on the distribution of expression values for a gene across technical or biological replicates - for this discussion we care less about comparing two genes within a sample

&lt;big&gt;

.pull-left[
**Microarray**
* Signal is fundamentally counts (deep down: photon detection)
* But values are averaged across pixels and counts are high
* Never really have zero: background
* "Continuous-like"
]
.pull-right[
**Sequencing**
* Unit of measurement is the read; no such thing as 0.2 read
* Counts of reads start at 0
* As counts get high, the distinction with microarrays should decrease
]

## Statistics of counts: Binomial


* Number of reads observed for gene `\(g\)` in a given sample is a random variable

* Say RNA for gene `\(g\)` is present "in the cell" at about 1 out of every 1,000,000 molecules 
  * Abundance `\(a_g=1/1,000,000 = 1\times10^{-6}\)` ("probability of success")
  
* If we randomly pick `\(R_i = \Sigma_gR_{ig} = 1,000,000\)` molecules ("reads" = "trials"), how many gene `\(g\)` RNAs will we see? `\(E(R_{ig} | R_i) = \,\, ?\)`
--

* But could get 0, 2, 3, 4, ... etc just by chance: this is a **Binomial** distribution 

  * probability distribution of the number of successes in `\(n\)` trials, each with probability of success `\(p\)` is `\((Binomial(n,p))\)` 
  
  * mean = `\(np\)`
  
  * In our example `\(R_{ig} \sim Binomial(R_i, a_g)\)` where `\(n=R_i\)` and `\(p=a_g\)`

---

## Statistics of counts: Poisson

* Poisson distribution counts discrete occurrences along a continuous interval of time/space 
  * parameterized by a rate parameter `\(\lambda\)`
  * key difference from Binomial: number of events can be infinitely large

* For count data, the variance is a function of the mean (*very* different from a normal)
  * Binomial: mean `\(= np\)`, variance `\(=np(1-p)\)`
  * Poisson: mean = variance = `\(\lambda\)`

---

## Statistics of counts: approximations

* **Binomial approximation of Poisson**:  for large `\(n\)` and small `\(np\)` (rule of thumb: `\(n\)` &gt; 20 &amp; `\(np\)` &lt; 5)
  * Approximately `\(R_{ig} \sim Poisson(R_ia_g)\)`
  
* **Binomial approximation of Normal**: For large `\(np\)` (rule of thumb: `\(np\)` &amp; `\(n(1-p)\)` &gt; 5)
  * Approximately `\(R_{ig} \sim Normal(R_ia_g, \, R_ia_g(1-a_g))\)`

# Overdispersion

Poisson OK for technical replicates, but **does not capture biological variability**

&lt;img src="img/overdisp.png" width="850" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Impact of heteroskedasticity 

.pull-left[
* OLS: assume all errors have the same variance (within gene)

* If not true, higher variance observations get more weight in minimization of error than they should (since less precise)

  * Standard errors of parameter estimates will be poor estimates
  
  * Recall: `\(t = \frac{\hat{\beta}}{\hat{se}(\hat{\beta})}\)`
  
  * ...So p-values will also be wrong - in case of positive relationship, too small

# Options for DE analysis on counts

&lt;big&gt;

* **Summary of the problem**: Count data is expected to violate both normality and constant variance assumptions

* Even microarray data usually has some mean-variance relation!

* Possibilities for coping:

  * Use a non-parametric test  (e.g. SAMseq â€“ based on Wilcoxon; will not discuss further â€“ lower power)
  
  * Make adjustments and model as usual
  
  * Use a model specific for count data

# Transformation can help

* For microarray data, taking logs is often deemed sufficient to reduce M-V trends

* We'll use plots like this which are mean vs `\(\sqrt{sd}\)` (quarter root variance) instead of mean vs variance (you'll see why later on)

* Behaviour of the "photoreceptor" microarray data set (raw on left, log-tranformed on right):
